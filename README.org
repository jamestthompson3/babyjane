Inpired by [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1e4t2k2KJY&t=2s][this talk]]. Let's make some trading robots.

## Layers
The exchange is broken down into three layers, they are the Matching, Communication, and Client layers.

### Communication Layer
A NodeJS socket used to communicate messages between the Matching layer and the clients.

### Matching Layer
A matching engine built in Rust

### Client Layer
Can be written in any language, they connect to the communication layer and recieve information being broadcast by the Matching layer
